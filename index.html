            <p>
                Thank you for taking the time to read my portfolio! My name is Cherry and I'm currently a full-time Information Technology Engineer at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Research Center. What has always drawn me to technology was my childhood. My father and brother spent their free time playing computer games, so my upbringing was surrounded by the exponential development in technology - dial-up being replaced by broadband and wi-fi, the dot-com bubble.
            </p>
            <p>
                Everything about technology fascinated me and continues to fascinate me. While I wasn't the biggest fan of the traditional educational academic environment, challenging subjects related to technology have always piqued my interest. On the hunt for more knowledge and learning, I've decided to attend a Coding Boot Camp. I chose full-stack because it combines two of my passions, streetwear & design with problem-solving.
